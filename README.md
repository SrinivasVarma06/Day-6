# Day-6

Using the KNearest Neighbors Classifier for classification.
The steps I followed are as follows:-
1. Encoded the target variable.
2. Standardized the data since KNN is a distance based model.
3. Split the data into training,validation and test data. Used the training data to train the model and validation data for finding the best k value.
4. Used the best model to predict on the test  data
5. Observed the decision boundaries.
